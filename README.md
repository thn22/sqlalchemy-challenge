## Description of the Project
For this project, I am planning on taking a vacation to Hawaii. To help with planning for the trip, I am running a climate analysis to decide on what to pack and what to do. The analysis consists of tracking weather station temperature observations and rainfall records. Then, I take the data and display it through a Flask app.

## Languages and Liabraries
Pandas, Matplotlib, SQLalchemy, Python, Flask

## Analysis and Discussion
See climate_starter.ipynb for analysis.
